# DynuDNS-Auto-Update-Script-bash
The script is very simple to setup. Simply download it, chmod +x it so you can execute it then fill in the variables such as your dynu username, password, domain and subdomain.

The Script will auto get your ip from an api. All you need to do is add a cronjob after to have it run every hour or however often you want.

Thanks
